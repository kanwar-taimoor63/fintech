# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
admin = AdminUser.create!(firstname: "Muhammad", lastname: "Haroon", email: "admin@fintech.com", password: "Password123!@#")
